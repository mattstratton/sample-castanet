## Getting started

After installing Castanet successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site running.


### The config file

You will need to add a handful of configuration items to your `config.toml` file. You can take a look at the [example site](http://github.com/mattstratton/castanet/blahblahblah) to see them in action. They are described below:

- `[params]`
  - `homepage` - the fully qualified domain name of your homepage. This is different than the `BaseURL` setting, as it must be externally available for feed readers, and others. This must NOT end with a slash. Example: `"https://www.mattstratton.com"`
  - `copyright_notice` - Your copyright information for the footer of the page. Can contain Markdown. Example: `"Copyright 2016 [Matt Stratton](https://www.mattstrattion.io)"`
  - `itunes_subscribe` - The URL of your podcast in the iTunes store. Optional. Example: `"http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/arrested-devops/id773888088?mt=2&uo=4&at=11lsCi"`

  - `mailchimp_subscribe` - The URL for your MailChimp signup form. This can be acquired from creating a "Super Slim" Embedded form on MailChimp. Additional instructions may be provided later. Do NOT include the entire form HTML; you just need the path for the `form action`. Optional.

#### Permalinks

I recommend the following permalink settings, although the theme will work just fine without them:

```
[permalinks]
	page = "/:filename/"
	about = "/:filename/"
	episode = "/:filename/"
```
